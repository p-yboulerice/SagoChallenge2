*************** DO NOT REMOVE THIS FILE UNLESS APPLE FIXED ODR UPDATE BUG ********************

This file is being added to Xcode project using BuildProcessor and marked with initial install tag.
Apple has confirmed that there is a bug with updating ODR if an app does not have any resources marked with initial install tag.
So we are adding this file to allow users to load any ODRs after going through App Store's update process.
